Graphical user interface for plotting different probability distributions. Made for a final project for "Introduction to Data Science" during Fall 2021 semester. Created as part of a team (Daniel Fanrobi (dafaronbi), Zhiyangli Hi (zhiyangli-hi)). 

This probability distribution player allows the user to select the probability distribution, x-range, parameter values, and y-scale (linear or log scale). The GUI can be updated by clicking the "Plot!" button after changing the above values.
